In the first chapter we built a simple application to track the energy \
consumption of a single building using multiple fuel sources.  This is the \
obvious place to start, and it will work for many schools.  Of course, many \
schools have several buildings, and you may find that not every building has \
its own meter.  You may also find meters on campus that \
don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t measure the consumption of a building.  For instance, \
I happen to live on a boarding school campus.  On that campus there are many \
buildings with their own meters, one building with two meters, and in the \
center of campus there is a single large transformer with a meter that serves \
several large academic buildings that do not have individual meters.  There \
are also meters not on buildings, but on  water pumps and parking lot lights. \
 There is similar complexity with regard to heating fuel, where there is a \
central plant that burns wood chips to heat much, but not all, of the campus.\

Points of Delivery, sometimes referred to Service Delivery Points, or Service \
Point Locations are the point at which a commodity is delivered from the  \
supplier to the  customer.  In the case of electricity supply, the Point of \
Delivery is typically the point at which the utility places a meter that \
measures electrical consumption by the customer.  In the case of fuel oil \
deliveries it would be the fill tube of the customer\[CloseCurlyQuote]s fuel \
tank.  In this case the measurement of the quantity delivered is done by a \
meter on the fuel oil truck, not by a meter installed at the customer\
\[CloseCurlyQuote]s facility.  Points of Delivery often supply a single \
building with an  commodity, although in many instances a point of delivery \
may supply many buildings, such as delivery of wood chips to a biomass boiler \
that heats many buildings on campus.  In some cases a Point of Delivery may \
not have any association with a building, such as metered street lights or \
water pumps.  It is for these reasons of multiple buildings being served by a \
single service delivery point, or a service delivery point having no building \
at all, that we require a concept distinct from campus buildings to associate \
measured quantities to.  \

Buildings and Points of Delivery are the  master data objects of interest to \
a campus energy management project.  By collecting and maintaining accurate \
master data you will be able to perform analyses that go far beyond what is \
possible with collecting energy consumption data alone.  For instance, if you \
have access to accurate information regarding the floor area of each building \
on campus, you will be able to calculate the energy intensity of each \
building.  If you include each building\[CloseCurlyQuote]s function, such as \
athletic facility, dormitory, administrative building you will be able to \
determine how much each function contributes to your \
school\[CloseCurlyQuote]s energy consumption.  
There are several possible methods of building a master data repository with \
the Wolfram Language.  This project is using the language\[CloseCurlyQuote]s \
EntityStore functionality.  If you wish, one can enter master data by brute \
force, and fully compose the code for each entry.  It is also possible to use \
the Language\[CloseCurlyQuote]s form building capabilities to construct a \
form to facilitate data entry.  \
