# Computational-Sustainability-Toolkit

I hope that these materials provide students with an understanding of how to use technology in their pursuit of a more sustainable world. 

To that end, these materials provide:

* A series of lessons on how to build applications with the Wolfram Language,
* An introduction to the concept of Computational Sustainability, 
* the source code of an application that students, and their school communities, can use to track and hopefully manage their school's energy consumption. 

## For School Groups
Implementing a project to monitor a school's energy consumption with this set of tools has only three prerequisites :
* a single individual willing to put in the required effort,
* a basic Wolfram Cloud account,
* the ability to record the values displayed on the school's utility meters.
