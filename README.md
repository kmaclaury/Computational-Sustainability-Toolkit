# Computational-Sustainability-Toolkit

I hope that these materials provide students with an understanding of how to use technology in their pursuit of a more sustainable world. 

To that end, these materials provide:

* A series of lessons on how to specify, build and deploy software generally, and specifically with the Wolfram Language,
* An introduction to the concept of Computational Sustainability, 
* the source code of an application that students, and their school communities, can use to track and hopefully manage their school's energy consumption. 

# A note on structure
This project is about much more than delivering the code for a software application.  In addition to the code produced, it is meant to provide an introduction to the processs of software design and an introduction to the concept of computational sustainability.  The introduction to the process of software design comes largely through the use of User Stories to specify the requested functionality. The introduction to Computational Sustainability comes through some of the background materials provided, as well as through the exercise of gathering and analyzing data.

 For those not familiar with the concept, User Stories are a common method of defining requirements in the world of software development.  The basic structure of a user story is to state who the user is, what the user needs to do, and why.   In the context of these materials, I hope that  pairing each incremental piece of code with a statement of the functional requirement that it satisfies will help to clarify the relationship between the two.  

## For School Groups
Implementing a project to monitor a school's energy consumption with this set of tools has only three prerequisites :
* a single individual willing to put in the required effort,
* a basic Wolfram Cloud account,
* the ability to record the values displayed on the school's utility meters.

Schools will be able to achieve much more when students, teachers and administrators collaborate together on a project, but a single student will be able to get things started.

## For Interested Contributors
There are many ways that individuals can contribute to this project.  Those interested in features that go beyond what has already been provided are welcome to submit feature requests, or better yet, to write out a user story that fully specifies the requested feature.  Those with background in energy management, or other related fields, are encouraged to provide background materials within the context of a specific user story.  Those with experience with the Wolfram Language are encouraged to provide code that satisfies the requirements spelled out in the user stories.  Since this project is as much about an education on the process of software development, as it is about delivering an application, all new features will be delivered with accompanying user stories and background materials.  

## Computational Sustainability
So, what is Computational Sustainability? On its website www.computational-sustainability.org the Institute for Computational Sustainability states:
* Computational Sustainability is an interdisciplinary field that aims to apply techniques from computer science, information science, operations research, applied mathematics, and statistics for balancing environmental, economic, and societal needs for sustainable development. Focus: developing computational and mathematical models and methods for decision making concerning the management and allocation of resources in order to help solve some of the most challenging problems related to sustainability. 

Computational Sustainability as a field extends far beyond energy consumption on school campuses, and at some point these materials may expand beyond that scope.  At the moment, focusing on energy consumption in schools is the place to start because of the immediate relevance to students, and the ability of students to have some influence on the energy consumed in their schools.
